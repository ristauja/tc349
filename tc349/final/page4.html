  <p>League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena game (MOBA). It was released in 2009 by Riot Games, a California based studio. All MOBA games can trace their roots back to the Warcraft III mod Defense of the Ancients (DOTA). After its release, League of Legends quickly became one of the most popular games out there. As of January 2014, over 67 million people play League of Legends per month. On top of that over 27 million people play per day, and over 7.5 million concurrently during peak hours.</p>

  <p>  In League of Legends, like many others in the MOBA genre, players take the role of one of over one hundred characters or as they are commonly known “champions”.  Each champion has four unique abilities and a unique play style. League of Legends is a team-based game, two teams of five players battle against each other in hopes of destroying their opponent’s nexus, which lies in the heart of the opposing teams base.</p>

    <p>  Along the way players have to work together to take down a mix of neutral monsters, towers, and more the powerful boss monsters Dragon and Baron Nashor.
    Unlike most games where the objective is to build one character over a long period of time, players play individual games on the same map known as “Summoner’s Rift”. Typical League of Legends games last from anywhere between 20 minutes to over an hour. The map has two sides, Blue and Red, and is split up into 3 separate lanes and a jungle filling up the space between each lane. Teams usually stick to a strict meta that involves one player going to the top lane, one to the middle lane, two players to the bottom lane, and the last player roaming through the jungle. </p>

    <p>  League of Legends has spawned one of the most active scenes in the professional gaming world. Riot Games organizes what they call the League of Legends Championship Series or LCS.  Riot Games has two separate LCS leagues, one for North America that takes place in their studios in Los Angeles California, and the other is a European league taking place in Cologne, Germany. The LCS is very similar to any professional sports league, there are 10 teams in each league that play each other every week. At the end of the season the top teams in their league play in a playoff, which ends with the top team wining their regional championship. At the end of every season the top teams from around the world come together to compete in the League of Legends World Championships. Around 20 teams from areas like North America, Europe, China, Southeast Asia, and South Korea all compete for over $2 million worth of prizes. One million of that prize money goes to the winning team. In 2013 over 32 million people watched the world championships. In 2014 the world championships had over 280 cumulative daily unique impressions. At the peak there were 11.2 million concurrent viewers. The South Korean team Samsung White ended up being the victors, claiming the trophy and over $1 million in prize money. </p>
